## Unboxing and Installing NVIDIA RTX 3090: The BFGPU
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dhS2mwXS4M

This Christmas #NVIDIA​ gifted me an #RTX​ #3090​ GPU and I decided to put it to good use. 

But before that, I needed to unbox and install it. So, I decided to make a video around it. 

This is my first unboxing video. I hope you like it :)

# Applied Machine Learning Framework

## 1) Episode 1.1: Intro and building a machine learning framework

Premiered Dec 26, 2019

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArygUBY0QXw&list=PL98nY_tJQXZnKfgWIADbBG182nFUNIsxw

This is the first video (part1) of my applied machine learning series.

In this video, I talk about the motivation for this channel and then show how you can create a re-usable machine learning framework for simple tabular datasets.

Due to the size of the video, I split them into 2 sub-episodes:

Episode 1.1 consists of motivation, setting up a web based IDE, creating an empty framework and creating model training

Episode 1.2 shows how the trained model can be used for inference.

The whole idea behind this episode is to create code which is re-usable, looks good and can be applied to many different kinds of problem without changing a lot of code.

Please let me know in comments what you want to learn and I will make it happen :)

# Tips & Tricks

## 1) Tips N Tricks #1: Send messages to Slack using Python

Dec 29, 2019

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDqjSd42024&list=PL98nY_tJQXZnoCDfHLo58tRHUyNvrRVzn

In the Tips N Tricks series, I will upload short videos with small tips that can help you with daily work.

In this video, I show how to build a small app to send #slack notifications from #python. 

You can use it to send you information and loss of model training, success/failure of models or for any kind of logs that you want.

Sandesh library is available on pip: pip install sandesh and github repo is here: https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/sandesh

## 2) Tips N Tricks #2: Setting up development environment for machine learning

Jan 9, 2020

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9lo_UxSkWA&list=PL98nY_tJQXZnoCDfHLo58tRHUyNvrRVzn&index=2

In  this short tips and tricks I talk about setting up a beautiful looking terminal and machine learning environment.

You can find the mlframework repository here: https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/mlframework

If there are some libraries that are missing from environment.yml, please feel free to send a comment or initiate a pull request

Current (extended) environment can be found here: https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/mlframework . 

It will be updated very frequently.



## 3) Tips N Tricks #3: Creating a clean inference kernel/notebook on Kaggle

Feb 2, 2020

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7Tsfrq_g18&list=PL98nY_tJQXZnoCDfHLo58tRHUyNvrRVzn&index=3

In this video, I show how to create a clean inference kernel/notebook on Kaggle. 

There are many new competitions on kaggle now-a-days that require you to submit an inference kernel and it becomes very messy as competitions progress and team grows. 

It is, therefore, a good idea to keep the code clean and readable (also applies to real world)

## 4) Tips N Tricks #4: Using joblib to speed up almost any function (example 1)

Mar 11, 2020

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny3O4VpACkc&list=PL98nY_tJQXZnoCDfHLo58tRHUyNvrRVzn&index=4

In this video, I show you how you can use joblib's multiprocessing to speed up almost any function. 

I present here only one example and will implement more examples in future if there is a demand from the audience.



## 5) Tips N Tricks #5: 3 Simple and Easy Ways to Cache Functions in Python

Premiered Mar 20, 2020

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_FDL0oRAWE&list=PL98nY_tJQXZnoCDfHLo58tRHUyNvrRVzn&index=5

In this video, I show three different and simple ways in which you can cache a function in python. 

Caching is one of the very important things when you are working in data science and machine learning. 

When there are a lot of requests to a function, you don't want to run and process all the data for each an every request. 

Instead, sometimes you just want to cache :)

## 6) Tips N Tricks #6: How to train multiple deep neural networks on TPUs simultaneously


Apr 18, 2020

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oWf4v6QEV8&list=PL98nY_tJQXZnoCDfHLo58tRHUyNvrRVzn&index=6

In this video, I will show you how you can train multiple neural networks on TPUs simultaneously. 

You can use this trick to train multiple folds for a dataset really quick and avoid all the optimization of hyperparameters that are usually associated with TPUs. 

I am not talking about how TPUs work.

Please note: you need to use "xm.optimizer_step(optimizer, barrier=True)" in the train_fn. This is not mentioned in the video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_P0ZIXspOU&list=PL98nY_tJQXZl0WwsJluhc6tGrKWCX2suH&index=1

In this special episode, I show how to train #BERT on a dataset with 30 target variables. 

You will need Google Cloud #TPU and an instance for the code. 

Its very important that they are in the same zone. I am using #pytorch !

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-3zts7FTDA&list=PL98nY_tJQXZl0WwsJluhc6tGrKWCX2suH&index=2


In this video I show how you can train your own language model e.g. BERT or any other configuration from scratch on Google's TPUs. 

Kaggle recently incorporated v3-8 TPUs in their Kernels/Notebooks and I will be using those. 

The Kernel is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/training-language-models-on-tpus-from-scratch


## 3) Training Sentiment Model Using BERT and Serving it with Flask API

Premiered Mar 7, 2020



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hinZO--TEk4&list=PL98nY_tJQXZl0WwsJluhc6tGrKWCX2suH&index=3


In this video, I will show you how you can train your own #sentiment model using #BERT as base model and then serve the model using #flask rest api.

The video focuses on creation of data loaders, creating a bert model using transformers python library, training the model and then doing inference using flask.

The model described here can achieve an accuracy of 93% on IMDB 50K Movie Reviews data set.

The training dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews

Bert base uncased files used in this video can be downloaded from here: https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/bert-base-uncased

- What courses need to be learnt for becoming a data scientist?
- Should you do MBA / MS in Data Science? What would be beneficial in the long run?
- Does a PhD help in getting into data science?
- Should one's PhD thesis be in line with the industry or can one do theoretical work and still hope to get into the industry
- How much of stats should I know to become a data scientist
- What are your views on kaggle’s micro courses ?
- Is command over tools like tensor flow, pytorch of utmost importance ?
- How to bag first internship in the field of data science
