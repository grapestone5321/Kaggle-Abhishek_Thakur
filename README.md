Abhishek Thakur is the chief data scientist at https://boost.ai building state-of-the-art chatbots primarily for banking and insurance industries. 

His passion lies in solving difficult world problems through data science. 

He is the co-organizer of the Berlin Machine Learning Meetup and not long ago was ranked no. 3 worldwide on the Data Science Platform Kaggle. 

He is a Competitions and Discussions Grandmaster. 

Abhishek did his Bachelors in Electronics Engineering from India and moved to Germany for pursuing MSc from University of Bonn, Germany with a focus on image processing and computer vision. 

He dropped out of PhD in 2015 and since then has been working in industries.

Kaggle Days Dubai was held May 30 - April 1 2019 as a part of AI Everything. Participants came to meet, learn and code with Kaggle Grandmasters, and compete in a full-day offline competition. 

This edition is presented by LogicAI with sponsorship from Kaggle and Google Cloud.

Kaggle Days are a global series of offline events for seasoned data scientists and Kagglers created by LogicAI and Kaggle.

### 3.1 Tips & Tricks

### 1) Tips N Tricks #1: Send messages to Slack using Python

Dec 29, 2019

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDqjSd42024&list=PL98nY_tJQXZnoCDfHLo58tRHUyNvrRVzn

In the Tips N Tricks series, I will upload short videos with small tips that can help you with daily work.

In this video, I show how to build a small app to send #slack notifications from #python. 

You can use it to send you information and loss of model training, success/failure of models or for any kind of logs that you want.

Sandesh library is available on pip: pip install sandesh and github repo is here: https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/sandesh

### 3.2 Applied Machine Learning Framework


### 3) Episode 2: A Cross Validation Framework

Premiered Jan 5, 2020

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wQlD46eICE&list=PL98nY_tJQXZnKfgWIADbBG182nFUNIsxw&index=3

This is the second episode of my video series on applied #machinelearning.

In this episode, we talk about the need for #cross #validation and different types of cross-validation. 

We also see how one can implement a re-usable cross validation framework.

In the end we are left with a cross validation framework that can be applied to almost all kinds of machine learning problem.

### 3.3 BERT


### 1) BERT on Steroids: Fine-tuning BERT for a dataset using PyTorch and Google Cloud TPUs

Jan 26, 2020

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_P0ZIXspOU&list=PL98nY_tJQXZl0WwsJluhc6tGrKWCX2suH&index=1

In this special episode, I show how to train #BERT on a dataset with 30 target variables. 

You will need Google Cloud #TPU and an instance for the code. 

Its very important that they are in the same zone. I am using #pytorch !

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-quest-challenge

Inference Kernel: https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/bert-inference-of-tpu-model/

### 2) Training BERT Language Model From Scratch On TPUs

Feb 15, 2020

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-3zts7FTDA&list=PL98nY_tJQXZl0WwsJluhc6tGrKWCX2suH&index=2


In this video I show how you can train your own language model e.g. BERT or any other configuration from scratch on Google's TPUs. 

Kaggle recently incorporated v3-8 TPUs in their Kernels/Notebooks and I will be using those. 

The Kernel is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/training-language-models-on-tpus-from-scratch


### 3) Training Sentiment Model Using BERT and Serving it with Flask API

Premiered Mar 7, 2020



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hinZO--TEk4&list=PL98nY_tJQXZl0WwsJluhc6tGrKWCX2suH&index=3


In this video, I will show you how you can train your own #sentiment model using #BERT as base model and then serve the model using #flask rest api.

The video focuses on creation of data loaders, creating a bert model using transformers python library, training the model and then doing inference using flask.

The model described here can achieve an accuracy of 93% on IMDB 50K Movie Reviews data set.

The training dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews

Bert base uncased files used in this video can be downloaded from here: https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/bert-base-uncased

Github repo with all the code will be shared after the premier.!
