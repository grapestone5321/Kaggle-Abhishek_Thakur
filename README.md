Abhishek Thakur is the chief data scientist at https://boost.ai building state-of-the-art chatbots primarily for banking and insurance industries. 

His passion lies in solving difficult world problems through data science. 

He is the co-organizer of the Berlin Machine Learning Meetup and not long ago was ranked no. 3 worldwide on the Data Science Platform Kaggle. 

He is a Competitions and Discussions Grandmaster. 

Abhishek did his Bachelors in Electronics Engineering from India and moved to Germany for pursuing MSc from University of Bonn, Germany with a focus on image processing and computer vision. 

He dropped out of PhD in 2015 and since then has been working in industries.

Kaggle Days Dubai was held May 30 - April 1 2019 as a part of AI Everything. Participants came to meet, learn and code with Kaggle Grandmasters, and compete in a full-day offline competition. 

This edition is presented by LogicAI with sponsorship from Kaggle and Google Cloud.

Kaggle Days are a global series of offline events for seasoned data scientists and Kagglers created by LogicAI and Kaggle.

### 3.1 Tips & Tricks

### 1) Tips N Tricks #1: Send messages to Slack using Python

Dec 29, 2019

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDqjSd42024&list=PL98nY_tJQXZnoCDfHLo58tRHUyNvrRVzn

In the Tips N Tricks series, I will upload short videos with small tips that can help you with daily work.

In this video, I show how to build a small app to send #slack notifications from #python. 

You can use it to send you information and loss of model training, success/failure of models or for any kind of logs that you want.

Sandesh library is available on pip: pip install sandesh and github repo is here: https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/sandesh

### 3.2 Applied Machine Learning Framework


### 3) Episode 2: A Cross Validation Framework

Premiered Jan 5, 2020

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wQlD46eICE&list=PL98nY_tJQXZnKfgWIADbBG182nFUNIsxw&index=3

This is the second episode of my video series on applied #machinelearning.

In this episode, we talk about the need for #cross #validation and different types of cross-validation. 

We also see how one can implement a re-usable cross validation framework.

In the end we are left with a cross validation framework that can be applied to almost all kinds of machine learning problem.

### 3.3 BERT


### 1) BERT on Steroids: Fine-tuning BERT for a dataset using PyTorch and Google Cloud TPUs

Jan 26, 2020

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_P0ZIXspOU&list=PL98nY_tJQXZl0WwsJluhc6tGrKWCX2suH&index=1

In this special episode, I show how to train #BERT on a dataset with 30 target variables. 

You will need Google Cloud #TPU and an instance for the code. 

Its very important that they are in the same zone. I am using #pytorch !

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-quest-challenge

Inference Kernel: https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/bert-inference-of-tpu-model/

### 2) Training BERT Language Model From Scratch On TPUs

Feb 15, 2020

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-3zts7FTDA&list=PL98nY_tJQXZl0WwsJluhc6tGrKWCX2suH&index=2


In this video I show how you can train your own language model e.g. BERT or any other configuration from scratch on Google's TPUs. 

Kaggle recently incorporated v3-8 TPUs in their Kernels/Notebooks and I will be using those. 

The Kernel is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/training-language-models-on-tpus-from-scratch


### 3) Training Sentiment Model Using BERT and Serving it with Flask API

Premiered Mar 7, 2020



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hinZO--TEk4&list=PL98nY_tJQXZl0WwsJluhc6tGrKWCX2suH&index=3


In this video, I will show you how you can train your own #sentiment model using #BERT as base model and then serve the model using #flask rest api.

The video focuses on creation of data loaders, creating a bert model using transformers python library, training the model and then doing inference using flask.

The model described here can achieve an accuracy of 93% on IMDB 50K Movie Reviews data set.

The training dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews

Bert base uncased files used in this video can be downloaded from here: https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/bert-base-uncased

Github repo with all the code will be shared after the premier.!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15TKkAPNUM&list=PL98nY_tJQXZl56Iyevs0D2CYEfmkGmKo2

Since a lot of people have asked me about my journey to become the world's first 4x grand master (and also first 3x grand master) on Kaggle and since I am not into blogs, I decided to rather make a YouTube video about it. 

I hope you like it :)

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me in comments. 

I try my best to reply/answer each comment that I receive.

### 3) How do I start my career in Data Science?

May 16, 2020

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFFM1JRo14E&list=PL98nY_tJQXZl56Iyevs0D2CYEfmkGmKo2&index=3

In this video, I provide my views on how you can start your career in data science. 

I collected a lot of questions from my followers and connections on Twitter and LinkedIn and have started posting vlog kind of videos which answer these questions. This is the first video of the Q&A series.

In this video, you can find answers to questions like:

- What courses need to be learnt for becoming a data scientist?
- Should you do MBA / MS in Data Science? What would be beneficial in the long run?
- Does a PhD help in getting into data science?
- Should one's PhD thesis be in line with the industry or can one do theoretical work and still hope to get into the industry
- How much of stats should I know to become a data scientist
- What are your views on kaggleâ€™s micro courses ?
- Is command over tools like tensor flow, pytorch of utmost importance ?
- How to bag first internship in the field of data science

In this video, I will show you how to approach an on-going #kaggle competition, specifically bengali.ai: grapheme classification.

This is a multi-label #classification challenge with over 200K images. 

I will be using #PyTorch to solve this problem. By the end of this tutorial you will be able to train any pre-trained model you want to train on this dataset!

Competition page: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bengaliai-cv19

The video is in two parts. In this part, we look at the data, start building the framework, create data set class and look at some images.


### 2) Bengali.AI: Handwritten Grapheme Classification Using PyTorch (Part-2)

Competition page: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bengaliai-cv19

The video is in two parts. 

In this part, we will build the framework for training any pretrained model we want to train, add augmentations, write the training script and the models and build the final inference.
